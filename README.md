# DataGuardian Application

This project contains the Front end of my the application I built during my master's research project. 

The purpose of this project was to build an application where users can view the 3 Ws WHO, WHEN, and from WHERE sombody accessed their posted content. In this way it gives more transparency and privacy over their data.

This application is connected to a users, posts, accesses and Blokchain APIs. I built a microservices architecture that serve data to this Frontend application.

Besides, I documantated my journey through this project on a research paper that is going to be published soon. 

# What did I learn?

-I learned a new way to scale transaction posting into Ethereum's blockchain network by applying off-chain techniques that allows to scale my application regardless of the number of accesses to user's data.
-I learned to code smart contracts in Solidity.
-I learned to deploy smart contacts to Ethereum's Sepolia Network using RedHat.
