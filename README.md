# DataGuardian Application

This project contains the Front end of the application I built during my master's research project. 

The app's purpose is to build an application where users can view the 3 Ws WHO, WHEN, and from WHERE somebody accessed their posted content. In this way, it gives more transparency and privacy over their data.

This application connects to users, posts, accesses, and Blockchain APIs. I built a microservices architecture that serves data to this Frontend application.

Besides, I documented my journey through this project in a research paper that will be published soon. 

# What did I learn?

ðŸ’¡I learned a new way to scale transaction posting into Ethereum's blockchain network by applying off-chain techniques that allow me to scale my application regardless of the number of accesses to user's data.

ðŸ’¡I learned to code smart contracts in Solidity.

ðŸ’¡I learned to deploy smart contacts to Ethereum's Sepolia Network using HardHat.
